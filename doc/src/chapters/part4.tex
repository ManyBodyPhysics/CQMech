\part{Monte Carlo Methods}
We start with an introduction to the basic Monte Carlo philosophy in the first chapter. Thereafter we discuss Markov chains and Brownian motion, we present the famous  Metropolis algorithm and discuss several applications of this algorithm to many problems in Science, from the simulation of phase transitions in materials, via studies quantum mechanical systems  to the simulation of stock markets and genomic data.
