\part{Linear Algebra and Eigenvalues}
This part of the text aims at giving an overview over several methods 
to solve linear algebra and eigenvalue problems. These methods span from
standard Gaussian elimination to iterative eigenvalue solvers for large 
eigenvalue problems. 
Furthermore, several technicalities which pertain to handling arrays, their memory allocation and deallocation, classes for handling arrays
and links to professional software packages such as LAPACK and BLAS will also be discussed. Parallelization of both eigenvalue solvers and linear algebra problems are also discussed.
