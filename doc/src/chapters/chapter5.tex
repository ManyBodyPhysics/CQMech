\chapter{Computational aspects}

\abstract{In this chapter
we discuss some of the classical methods for integrating a function. The methods we discuss are  the trapezoidal, rectangular and Simpson's rule for equally spaced 
abscissas  and integration approaches  
based on Gaussian quadrature. The latter are more suitable
for the case where the abscissas are not equally spaced. 
The emphasis is on 
methods for evaluating few-dimensional (typically up to four dimensions) integrals. In
chapter \ref{chap:mcint} 
we show how Monte Carlo methods can be used to compute multi-dimensional
integrals.
We discuss also how to compute 
singular integrals.
We end this chapter with an extensive discussion on MPI and parallel computing.
The examples focus on parallelization of algorithms for computing integrals. }
