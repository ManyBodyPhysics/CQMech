\part{Advanced topics}
The last part of this book contains several project oriented advanced topics.
Each of these topics can serve as a regular one-semester course based on the 
solution of the pertinent projects.  We present several topics, mainly within
applications to quantum mechanical systems and statistical mechanics. 
We discuss Hartree-Fock and density-functional theory 
calculations for electronic systems, variational
and diffusion Monte Carlo calculations of many-particle systems
(atoms, quantum dots and Bose-Einstein condensation), large molecular-dynamics
calculations of solids, percolation and critical phenomena and advanced
simulations of phase transitions.
